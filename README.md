# Android App Market Analysis on Google Play

This project analyzes the Android app market on Google Play using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, plotly, and seaborn.

## Project Overview

The project aimed to explore the Android app market on Google Play and answer questions such as which categories have the highest share of apps, the distribution of app ratings, the correlation between app size and price, and the popularity of paid vs free apps.

## Key Findings

- The majority of top-rated apps (rating over 4) range from 2 MB to 20 MB, and the vast majority of apps price themselves under $10.
- Medical and Family apps are the most expensive, with some medical apps priced up to $80.
- Junk apps, which are priced over $100, were filtered out from the dataset.
- Paid apps are installed less than free apps.
- Free apps receive a lot of harsh comments, while reviews for paid apps appear never to be extremely negative.
- The median polarity score for paid apps is a little higher than free apps.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides insights into the Android app market on Google Play and can be useful for app developers and marketers. The findings suggest that app developers should focus on creating high-quality apps that are reasonably priced and have a smaller size. Additionally, marketers should consider offering free apps with in-app purchases to increase their popularity and revenue.
